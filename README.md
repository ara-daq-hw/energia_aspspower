# ASPS-Power firmware

This is the ASPS-Power firmware, built using the Energia framework.

Note that this needs the ASPS-Power variant board definition located in the
'hardware' directory in this github. Copy the 'hardware' directory here to
the Energia installation directory (you will replace the 'boards.txt' file).

Then select the board in Energia with 'Tools->Board->ASPS-POWER w/MSP430F2274',
and upload the program.
